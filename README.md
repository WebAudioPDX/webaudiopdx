## The Web Audio meetup of Portland, Oregon
WebAudioPDX is a monthly meetup for anyone interested in getting into Web Audio and other music & sound related web technologies (not limited to the web only)! We're here to be a great place for **artists & technologists** to converse, and make awesome things together.

### Montly Meetups
We meet every last Thursday at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/portland/)! Join our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Audio-PDX/) group for current event info, announcements, and to see who's coming (RSVP)! We also share event info and general resources via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/webaudiopdx)!

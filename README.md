The Web Audio meetup of Portland, Oregon.

Join our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Audio-PDX/) group, and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/webaudiopdx)!
 
### We use github to submit talk, demo, and performance proposals!
Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/WebAudioPDX/webaudiopdx/issues/new) to propose something awesome to share with us! Talks can take a lightning form, long form, or something inbetween them. We're excited to see your demos! Show off what you've been doing with Web Audio to further your own creative process, or everyone else's!

We abide by our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md) for meetups, and everything we do. We kindly ask you to do the same.

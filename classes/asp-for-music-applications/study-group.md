# Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications Class
Here at [WebAudioPDX](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Audio-PDX/) there's a general interest in signal processing as applied to audio & music, which is at the heart of Web Audio itself. Stanford (CCRMA) is offering an in-depth, [free course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) on this via coursera.

## Study Group
Some of us have already started getting into the coursework since the class started up this week (9/25/17), and are interested in joining up periodically for a study group! The logistics will be discussed at [tonight's meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Audio-PDX/events/243431335/), after which this file will be updated with the exact time & dates the study group will meet.

## Study Group Schedule
As mentioned, the time & dates will be set in stone after tonight's meet, but it will probably take the form of an hour get-together (longer for those who want to stay) at a central PDX coffee shop, either early in the morning (before general working hours) or at lunchtime.

More to come soon.

# Update (10/23/17)
After a fair amount of consideration we decided that at this juncture offering workshops and other resources will most likely be more productive and an easier entry point for our group towards worthwhile programming tools and fundamental concepts around digital signal processing for music applications. This class is incredible and individuals should be highly encouraged to take it on their own. We will most likely save this class 'in our pocket' and pick it up as a group when it becomes available again.

# Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications Class
Here at [WebAudioPDX](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Audio-PDX/) there's a general interest in signal processing as applied to audio & music, which is at the heart of Web Audio itself. Stanford (CCRMA) is offering an in-depth, [free course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) on this via coursera.

## Study Group
Some of us have already started getting into the coursework since the class started up this week (9/25/17), and are interested in joining up periodically for a study group! The logistics will be discussed at [tonight's meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Web-Audio-PDX/events/243431335/), after which this file will be updated with the exact time & dates the study group will meet.

## Study Group Schedule
As mentioned, the time & dates will be set in stone after tonight's meet, but it will probably take the form of an hour get-together (longer for those who want to stay) at a central PDX coffee shop, either early in the morning (before general working hours) or at lunchtime.

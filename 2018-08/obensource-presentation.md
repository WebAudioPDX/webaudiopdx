  * JavaScript (Currently at [ZHealth](https://zhealthdocumentation.com/etch-suite/))
  * The [WWW](https://www.w3.org/) + [Web Audio](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/) & [Web MIDI](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/) + [JS](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) = [Totally blows my mind](https://m.popkey.co/574b46/WxVke.gif)
  * My Background:
    - Music Performance (Composition, Performing)
    - Audio Engineering (Recording, Signal Processing)
    - Application Developement (CS, JavaScript, Node.js)

### Slide 6: Why are you stoked about Web Audio?
A series of open questions to the group.
* Q: How many people here write JavaScript?
    * A: Almost every hand raised.
* Q: How many people here are musicians?
    * A: Almost every hand raised
* Q: How many people here have done or do Audio Engineering ([Audio recording](), [ASP]()/[DSP](), etc)
    * A: Almost every hand raised.
* Q: Why are you stoked about Web Audio?
    * A: Answers varied based on context and use case, but general consensus is build new cross-platform collaboratvie tools and applications that are possible now given the native broswer APIs.

### Slide 7: Q: What would you like to see happen at WebAudioPDX?
* A: Answers varied slighty, but general consensus was for the opportunity to dive deeper, collaborate, and develop awesome apps & tools together.

### Slide 8-10: What are the Web Audio & WebMIDI APIs?
* A [browser-native api]() exposing a directed graph of [unit generators]().
* A [browser-native api]() implenting the [MIDI spec]().
* And everything else that makes the web work
  * What does this mean for developers?
    * It's still a new API, currently being developed, so contribute and build awesome stuff!
  * What does this mean for musicians & audio engineers?
    * What’s possible & coming up is epic, we need your help!

### Slide 11-15: So, what is WebAudioPDX about?
* **Developers, Musicians, and Audio Engineers–collaborating!**
* **Developer's Takeaway**:
  * Learn
  * Make connections & build things with other interdisciplinary people 
  * Work with musicians in design & R&D
  * Achieve and publish passion projects, etc.
  * Help open source the music process with apps, and resources that make making audio & music achievable to everyone.
* **Musician's Takeaway**:
  * Web Audio needs musicians & audio engineers! (Like really really badly)
  * The gap between music performers/producers/artists & developers is really big.
  * Typically a developer builds out an idea & demos it themself (without much performance experience) to an audience which may or may not understand the potential of the underlying technology for it's applied field. This is then often received by a slow clap, a ‘that was neat’, and that’s it. If you as a musician are involved with the design and R&D process of super intriguing and useful applications, then going on to have you and/or other professional musicians demonstrate them to an appreciative audience will garner the success and growth of those projects.
  * You get to explore, discover, and be a part of the destiny of your own new forms of instrumentation, collaborative expression, creative processes, and performance methodology.
  * The result of your work is published and readily available to be used by you, and the public.
* **Audio Engineer's Takeaway**:
  * Help design, research, and develop tooling which will be revolutionary to your studio processes.
  * Sync up with like minded individuals who want to make amazing studio/recording technology utilizing the power of that WebAudio, Web MIDI, and network tools have to offer!

### Slide 16: Expectations & Reality
* Sometimes things move slower than we’d like, and sometimes things we want to happen don’t happen the way we ‘imagined’ they would. But I can guarantee you that everyone involved in making this meet up happen really wants to see pdx people thrive in their projects and web audio based goals. However big or small.

### Slide 17: WebAudioPDX & WebSound
* Our meetup organization will naturally produce great applications and tooling, and we want to [keep these projects & efforts centralized](https://github.com/WebAudioPDX/webaudiopdx/issues/3) so the public associates our awesome work with a great name that represents us & knows where to find us. This will empower our collective efforts.
* Given that, we're adopting [WebSound](https://github.com/websound) as our umbrella organization to publically publish our work.

### Slide 18: Submit Talks!
* Please submit talks!
  * We have interest from Web Audio folks at Google & Mozilla already who're stoked to share about what's going on with the project. So look out for that!
  * Propose a talk to give to our group by submitting a new [WebAudioPDX issue](https://github.com/WebAudioPDX/webaudiopdx/issues/new)!
* Propose projects to us, get people involved!
  * Propose a new project to the group, or invite others to join your ongoing one by submitting a new [WebSound issue](https://github.com/websound/WebSound/issues).

### Slide 19: Become an Organizer
* Help us organize this meetup! We need help! You can help us with:
  * Meetup Logistics
  * Github org maintenence
  * Developing our site(s) and web presence
  * Acquiring sponsorship for various needs and efforts
* Contact [obensource](https://twitter.com/obensource) if you're interested in helping us make this meetup insanely awesome!

### Slide 20: Spearhead future events
* We're aiming to organize future Web Audio events! We need help to make this a reality!
* It's one thing to build amazing apps and tools, but we need to demo them publically.
* Music venues in PDX are a perfect fit for this. Obensource will elaborate more on this soon as our projects grow.

### Slide 21: Sponsor us!
* Please <a href="mailto:webaudiopdx@gmail.com?Subject=Sponsoring WebAudioPDX!" target="_top">contact us</a> if you're interested in sponsoring our meetup group!
* We will be setting up an account with [OpenCollective](opencollective.com) soon to streamline this process and keep everthing tidy.

# 2018-08-29: Web Audio PDX Meeting Notes

## WebAudioPDX up-to-date by [obensource](https://github.com/obensource)

### Tonight's topic: Let’s get cracking! 
AKA "What are y’all up to?" -or- "What have you been building?" -or- "Let’s Build Stuff Together!"

#### Announcements & Logistics

**Announcements**
* I recently started up a conversation with the Experience Director of the Portland Children’s museum, and he’s interested in continuing a conversation about us setting up a ‘distributed music’ station where kids can play with each other in realtime between PDX and Phoenix (where he held the same position before). This is a great opportunity to so something that will be meaningful and get great exposure for our group. Just gotta get the repo going and get cracking!
* [Audio Signal Processing for music applications](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) study group! The class started yesterday and we need to establish a weekly study that generally works for everyone. Probably for an hour either from 7:45-8:45, or a lunch time meet up. People who want to stay longer can definitely do that.
  * Update: after a fair amount of consideration we decided that at this juncture offering workshops and other resources will most likely be more productive and an easier entry point for our group towards worthwhile programming tools and fundamental concepts around digital signal processing for music applications. 

**Group Member Logistics**
* Join our Slack group! (ask [obensource](https://twitter.com/obensource) to add you)

* [Nate](https://github.com/vine77) and I are interested in diving into [conversations about future standards](https://github.com/WebAudioPDX/specs-and-standards) in Web Audio such as a [VST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) implementation and [General MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI).

#### Summary of meeting
* [Ben](https://github.com/obensource) lead the group through announcements & logistics, and then gave the time over to the group to share projects they've been working on.
* Amazing demos were given by group members, in a share & respond hangout format: an audio driven choose-your-own-adventure game, a tuning teaching system, a synthesizer with a spiral interface, etc.

#### Our Current Channels
* [Web Audio PDX](https://github.com/webaudiopdx): a place for our meetup resources, talk/demo proposals, meetup related projects, etc.
* [WebSound](https://github.com/websound) our collective umbrella org for app/tool development and publishing.
